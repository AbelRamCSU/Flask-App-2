    <p>A completely unnecessary explanation of a completely unnecessary game.</p>

  <main>
    <p>
      • The grid is 3×3, so there are 9 boxes.<br>
      • One box is secretly chosen as the “winning” box on the server side.<br>
      • When you click a box, the app checks if your choice matches the winning index.<br>
      • If you’re wrong, you get a configurable roast. If you’re right, you get a
        configurable win message.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s it. There are no points, no rewards, and no scoreboard.<br>
      Just vibes and bad decisions.
