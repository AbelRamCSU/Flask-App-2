    <p>Because sometimes learning Flask means building things that don’t matter.</p>

  <main>
    <p>
      This application was built as part of a CIS class project to practice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Flask routes and templates</li>
      <li>Extending a shared <code>base.html</code> layout</li>
      <li>Handling form submissions and POST requests</li>
      <li>Adding a consistent visual theme across multiple pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Under the hood, the app randomly selects a winning box index
      (0–8 for a 3×3 grid) and compares it to the value you clicked.
